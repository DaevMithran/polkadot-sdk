  - audience: Node Operator
    description: |
      Introduces an experimental collator that is fit fot elastic-scaling.
      It can be activated on `test-parachain` and `polkadot-parachain` binaries via
      `--experimental-use-slot-based` flag. The current implementation is MVP status and purely
      for testing. Behaviour can change any time and should not be relied upon in environments with
      any stability requirements.
